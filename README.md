  - Given the substantial immigrant population and diversity of New York City, the goal was to determine the fairness of the SAT by comparing its results to data on racial composition, gender, and safety of the borough, as well as identify any unintended patterns or reasons that discriminate against specific groups of students. Is SAT unfair, if certain ethnic groups consistently outperform others?
