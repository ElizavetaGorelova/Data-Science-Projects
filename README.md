## Overview:

[Airbnb Data Analysis | New York](https://nbviewer.org/github/ElizavetaGorelova/DataAnalysis_Projects/blob/e727d1018eac999b3954591a18413d05dc99bf89/Airbnb%20Data%20Analysis%20_%20New%20York.ipynb)
  - Conducted a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the Airbnb NYC data in order to explore how each variable's phenomena act separately and in relation to one another. The analysis has a clear, concise framework that is well-detailed across all areas, with the goal of simultaneously creating an easy-to-follow manual outlining the actions that must be taken to conduct an effective analysis.

[Analysis of NYC High School Data and SAT results](https://github.com/ElizavetaGorelova/DataAnalysis_Projects/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data%20and%20SAT%20results/Analysis%20of%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data%20andSAT%20results.ipynb)
  - Given the substantial immigrant population and diversity of New York City, the goal was to determine the fairness of the SAT by comparing its results to data on racial composition, gender, and safety of the borough, as well as identify any unintended patterns or reasons that discriminate against specific groups of students. Is SAT unfair, if certain ethnic groups consistently outperform others?

[Determining the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/ElizavetaGorelova/DataAnalysis_Projects/tree/main/Determining%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In)
  - A hypothetical e-learning company offers courses on programming, web and mobile development, data science, game development, and more. The company has tasked me with identifying the two best markets to advertise their product in.

[Analysis of EUR-USD and EUR-GBP Exchange Rates](https://github.com/ElizavetaGorelova/DataAnalysis_Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20EUR-USD%20and%20EUR-GBP%20Exchange%20Rates)
  - Investigated the variability of the exchange rates EUR-USD (United States) and EUR-GBP (United Kingdom) and determined their behavior during the 2007-2008's financial crisis period. Additionally, a quick observation of the variability of the EUR-GBP exchange rate from 2016 to 2019 (Brexit) was done.

[Customers and Products Analysis](https://github.com/ElizavetaGorelova/DataAnalysis_Projects/blob/main/Customers%20and%20Products%20Analysis/Customers%20and%20Products%20Analysis.ipynb)
  - This analysis aims to examine the questions and concerns the hypothetical company has and derive responses from the data. The goal is to review and analyze its dataset in order to make some critical decisions about potential future expansion.

[Analysing eBay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/ElizavetaGorelova/DataAnalysis_Projects/tree/main/Analysing%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data)
